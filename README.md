## What I Learned:

- Strengthened my **Wireshark** and **PCAP analysis** skills to investigate web-based intrusions.  
- Learned how to trace **web shell uploads**, identify **exfiltration attempts**, and recognize **attacker behavior** through network patterns.  
- Understood the importance of **directory enumeration** and **filtering HTTP traffic** for incident response.  
- Improved my capability to analyze **HTTP methods, ports, and outbound connections** used in attacks.  

This lab deepened my understanding of **real-world web exploitation and network forensic investigation** â€” essential for any **SOC or Blue Team analyst**.
